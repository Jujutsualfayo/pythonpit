# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## 📘 Description

This project is the first step towards building a full-stack clone of the [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com) web application. It is part of the ALX Software Engineering program. 

The goal is to build a command-line interface (CLI) that serves as the foundation for managing data models, persisting data to files, and laying the groundwork for future API and frontend development.

The console interprets user commands to create, retrieve, update, and destroy instances of various data models including:

- `BaseModel`
- `User`
- `Place`
- `State`
- `City`
- `Amenity`
- `Review`

## 🖥️ The Command Interpreter

### 🔧 How to Start It

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/AirBnB_clone.git
   cd AirBnB_clone
